# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Overview

This challenge involved creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## This app meets the grading criteria as it:

* Displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Presents time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-codes each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
 
* Allows a user to enter an event when they click a time block

* Allows a user to save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
